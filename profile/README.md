### About Gimlet.io

Gimlet.io is a startup focused on getting the Netlify experience onto Kubernetes and the cloud native ecosystem.

Founded in 2020, headquartered in Szeged, Hungary, we're a small but growing team of engineers on the mission to make the Gimlet open-source, gitops based developer platform the obvious choice for cloud native platform builders.

We are mostly remote and hiring remotely in the CEE (Central and Eastern Europe) region.
